# Dependencies
# ============
#
# Version policy
# --------------
# The policy in specifying dependencies versions are to use tilde requirements
# according to
# <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html?highlight=feature#tilde-requirements>
# with full semver version specification (major, minor and patch components)
# which means that we may upgrade for patches/bugfixes, but must not change
# even the minor version of the package.
# Once the library is stable consider upgrading tilde requirements to strict
# equivalence requirements (with '=' sign) since even dependencies patching will
# not introduce risk of breaking the consensus and even security updates must
# be done manualy after through testing
[dependencies]
# Dependencies on other LNP/BP repositories
# -----------------------------------------

#   a part of Tor address)
ed25519-dalek = { version = "~1.0.0", optional = true }
# Core rust projects
# ------------------
#   This strange naming is a workaround for cargo inability to define required
#   features for a dependency. See
#   <https://github.com/rust-lang/api-guidelines/issues/180> for the explanation
#   and references.

# Networking deps
# ---------------

# Temporary-needed dependencies:
# ------------------------------
# 1. We are of no control of what's happening in Grin and would like to prevent
#    updates w/o checking them manually. Should Elements Project secpk256k-zkp
#    accept bulletproofs code, we will switch to it

#    crates they should be removed

# Forked dependencies
# -------------------
# Some of the functionality required for
# LNP/BP development related to the base Bitcoin protocol and Lightning Network
# is contributed by LNP/BP Association directly into corresponding libraries;
# however sometimes the present library requires changes in them that can't or
# not yet accepted by the community. This brings necessity to maintain our own
# forks of the dependencies. Sometimes upstream crates does not have any PRs
# by LNP/BP, but we still need to patch them with importing underlying forked
# versions (like `bitcoin` in `miniscript`), otherwise we are getting library
# conflicts breaking compilation
# NB: These patches MUST be applied in exactly same manner by any library which
#     uses this as a dependency
[patch.crates-io]
# We need this b/c of breaking change in tagged hash type generation
