# Dependencies
# ============
#
# Version policy
# --------------
# The policy in specifying dependencies versions are to use tilde requirements
# according to
# <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html?highlight=feature#tilde-requirements>
# with full semver version specification (major, minor and patch components)
# which means that we may upgrade for patches/bugfixes, but must not change
# even the minor version of the package.
# Once the library is stable consider upgrading tilde requirements to strict
# equivalence requirements (with '=' sign) since even dependencies patching will
# not introduce risk of breaking the consensus and even security updates must
# be done manualy after through testing

#   a part of Tor address)
ed25519-dalek = { version = "~1.0.0", optional = true }
# Core rust projects
# ------------------
#   This strange naming is a workaround for cargo inability to define required
#   features for a dependency. See
#   <https://github.com/rust-lang/api-guidelines/issues/180> for the explanation
#   and references.

# ---------------

# Temporary-needed dependencies:
# ------------------------------
# 1. We are of no control of what's happening in Grin and would like to prevent
#    updates w/o checking them manually. Should Elements Project secpk256k-zkp
#    accept bulletproofs code, we will switch to it

#    functionality will become part of either amplify_derive or lnpbp_derive
#    crates they should be removed
